# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project aims at predicting the occurence of heart disease using ensemble method and comparing the ensemble method results to the individual algorithms used and plotting confuson matrixes. 

The ensemble method produced 90% testing accuracy. The jupyter notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/camadi/Heart-Disease-Prediction/blob/master/Heart-Disease-Analysis.ipynb).
